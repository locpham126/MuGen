# MuGen

This application was generated using JHipster 8.1.0, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v8.1.0](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v8.1.0).

## Project Structure

Mu-Gen is a web app that asks the user to put in a song or playlist and then uses ai to generate unique images based off the songs. The data that will be used to feed into the ai prompts will be based off of sound bites, lyrics, and genres. When the images are created, the user can then save them into their devices and share as they wish or for personal use such as backgrounds. The app can also be used as a music player, playing music alongside with the generation of images.

My mvp will allow the user to play music and generate unique images based on song input.

Iâ€™ll build this project using Spring, Java, SQL DB, and Angular front end.
